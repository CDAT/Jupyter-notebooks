    "# Remove Climatological Mean Annual Cycle and Detrend Data <a id='top' class=\"tocSkip\"> </a>\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use [CDAT](https://cdat.llnl.gov) to remove the climatological mean annual cycle and detrend data - a common procedure applied prior to detailed climate data analysis of monthly anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data considered in this notebook are monthly-mean surface air temperatures gridded over the United States and spanning the years 1850 - 1990. The original dataset is complete, but it is artificially modified in this notebook by \"masking\" some values, yielding an incomplete dataset with some values \"missing\" (as is often encountered in analysis of climate data). The analysis procedure involves three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove the climatological annual cycle yielding monthly-mean departures.\n",
    "2. Spatially average over the domain.\n",
    "3. Remove the time-mean and the linear trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are missing values in the dataset (as in the sample calculations below), the final detrended time-series will depend on the order in which these steps are executed.  Here we examine options for detrending the data, and we show that slightly different results are generated depending on the order in which operations are performed.  More sophisticated treatments (not discussed here) involving appropriately weighting samples and collections of samples should be considered for datasets that only sparsely cover the time and space domains.\n",

    "[Back to Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before detrending a time series, it is often best to filter it by removing the climatological mean annual cycle; in fact, this may be a requirement for particular types of analyses. In the case of a time series that does not span an integral/non-fractional representative number of years, an accurate determination of the trend of interest may require removal of the climatological mean annual cycle. To see why, consider a temperature time series starting in January and ending in July a year and a half later (i.e., *not* an integral number of years). Over Northern Hemisphere continents with a large annual cycle, the ending temperature would be much higher than the beginning temperature simply due to the usual seasonal changes in temperature. A linear fit to the time-series would result in a trend that would not reflect any real change in climate but just the particulars of the time period treated. To avoid such artificial trends, one should first remove the climatological annual cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface temperature data considered earlier has no missing data, but more often than not observational datasets are incomplete. For purposes of illustration, we therefore will first modify the original surface temperature dataset by designating certain values as \"missing\". Specifically, we'll treat as \"missing\" (i.e., delete or mask) all data values that are within 7 degrees of the maximum temperature (`data.max()-7`) and store the result in `datamskd`."

Recall that the missing data occur in the warmest part of the domain during the warmest part of the year.

This explains why there are some positive differences in the latter part of the time series. The very small negative differences at other times simply are required to maintain a time mean of zero. Note that if the values were \"missing\" for a given grid cell every year at the same time of year, then they would not affect the regional mean and would not lead to unrealistic anomalies, but the values are only missing in the later part of the dataset (due to the long-term warming trend).\n",
