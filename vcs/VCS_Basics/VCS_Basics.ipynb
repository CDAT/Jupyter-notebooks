We recommend you also look at the [CDMS 101](../../cdms/cdms2_101/cdms2_101.html) notebook.\n",

For more details, see the [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) section below.\n",

    "We recommend using conda to install and manage environments. Conda itself can be installed either via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink version) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (the minimalist version). \n",
    "\n",
    "I prefer Miniconda since it takes up less room on my computer and I don't mind installing the various packages I need when I need them. [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)) will install Python on your computer. If you already have Python installed on your computer, see [this helpful page](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#installing-conda-on-a-system-that-has-other-python-installations-or-packages). The choice of whether to install the Python 2.x or Python 3.x version of Miniconda will affect only your root environment. You can create both Python 2.x and Python 3.x environments with either version of Miniconda installed (and many environments can exist on your computer at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "When installing Miniconda or Anaconda, let the installer add the conda installation of Python to your PATH environment variable. On a Mac or Linux machine, if asked \"Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?\" or something similar, we recommend saying \"yes\". For more details see [this page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#installing-anaconda).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a CDAT Compatible Environment\n",
    "Once you have a version of Miniconda (or Anaconda) installed, create a CDAT or Jupyter-VCDAT environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For CDAT\n",
    "1. Type the following code at a command line prompt. Note, since all output of code in this notebook will be displayed within the notebook, we do not need a separate display window so we can use the mesalib (or headless display) version of the latest version of the cdatX.x environment, which is currently cdat8.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda create -n cdat81-mesa -c cdat/label/v81 -c conda-forge python=3.6 cdat mesalib\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the cdat81-mesa environment is installed, activate it by typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda activate cdat81-mesa\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### For VCDAT and the jupyter-vcdat environment\n",
    "1. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/CDAT/jupyter-vcdat/wiki/Deploy#from-source) for installing VCDAT 2.0 on your personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the jupyter-vcdat environment (and VCDAT) have been installed, activate the environment with:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda activate jupyter-vcdat\n",
    "    ``` \n",

    "### If \"conda activate\" doesn't work\n",
    "Try: \n",
    "```\n",
    "    source activate name_of_environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start JupyterLab\n",
    "Once you have a cdatXx-mesa or jupyter-vcdat environment activated, navigate to the parent folder that contains this notebook, then type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    jupyter-lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note**: you must launch JupyterLab from the highest level folder you want to be able to access. Jupyter can see folders below the directory from which it was launched, but it cannot see directories above its launch directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not want to use the enhanced JupyterLab interface, you can run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    jupyter-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "to load only the notebook without the JupyterLab interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebook) has started, you may be asked to pick a Kernel. Choose the generic Python 3 environment or cdatXx-mesa or jupyter-vcdat. If you chose the generic Python 3 environment that means Jupyter will use whichever Python environment started the JupyterLab (or Jupyter Notebook) session. Hence it is best to start the JupyterLab session from an environment that contains CDAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, VCDAT and VCS are two different CDAT modules though they have similar acronyms. [VCDAT 2.0](https://vcdat.llnl.gov) helps you visualize, manipulate data, and test out code within the JupyterLab interface. [VCS](https://cdat-vcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) stands for Visualization Control System which allows you to create customized plots and animations."
