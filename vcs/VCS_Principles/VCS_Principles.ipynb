    "[Back to Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the scientific piece of information that the user is trying to represent for others (or oneself) to understand. It can be as raw as a simple numpy object. It is recommended to use [CDMS](https://github.com/uv-cdat/cdms)'s transient variables. CDMS transient variables contain metadata such as name, units, and geospatial information that can be used by VCS to better represent the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Graphic methods also describe how axes and labels should be represented (e.g. which axis values to show and which text to use for the values. The user might want to show the `-20.` longitude represented as `20S` or the date `2020-01-15` shown as `Jan 2020`. \n",

    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#top)\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxfill is used to represent 2-dimensional arrays, filling each array cell with a color representing its value. In the case of rectilinear grids where x and y axes can be represented by a 1-dimensional array, we use the axes **bounds** to determine the extent of each cell. This is especially useful if an axis is not increasing constantly (e.g. a gaussian grid or pressure levels).\n",
